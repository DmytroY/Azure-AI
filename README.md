# Azure  AI services

While study Azure AI I try every API, train and deploy several AI models try them. This repo contains my examples of usage APIs :
* az_AI_search (folder) - flask application which provide simple site to search preindexed documents in Azure AI search resource.
* az_ai_search.ipynb - AI search in the indexed documents simple demonstration in jupyter notebook.
* az_content_safety_jaibrake.ipynb - using Prompt shield of Azure content safety.
* az_content_safety_text.ipynb - using Azure content safety for categorising text in 4 categories (Hate, SelfHarm,Sexual, Violence).
* az_custom_entiti_recogn.ipynb - using Azure AI Language studio to train and deploy model, API for prediction.
* az_custom_vision.ipynb - TRAINING, REGISTERATION and PREDICTION with custom image clasification model
* az_detect_faces.ipynb - Detecting faces by Azure AI Face API with next features: head pose, blur and mask type
* az_detect_people.ipynb - Detecting people by Azure visual analysis with "PEOPLE" VisualFeature
* az_image_analysis.ipynb - usage Azure AI vision API for image analysis
* az_image_detection.ipynb - Train, publish and use image detection model with Azure Custom Vision
* az_inteligence.ipynb - Extract information from documents
* az_key_vault_usage.py - usage Azure Key Vault to access Azure Cognitive Services.
* az_ML_CLU.ipynb - Conversational Language Understating model for interpret voice commands.
* az_ML_train_connect.ipynb - connecting to trained Linear Regression model.
* az_OCR.ipynb - using AI vision API for recognition handwrited text.
* az_QnA.ipynb - API interface to Azure Custom question answering knowlege base
* az_speech_recogn.ipynb - Speech to text
* az_speech_translator.py - translate speech to other language with Azure Speech Service
* az_speech_tts_stt.py - using Azure SDK API for recognize speech and than answer aloud(or save wav file)
* az_text_analysis - Text analysis with Azure cognitive service 
* az_tet_clasification.ipynb - Custom text clasification with Azure cognitive service API
* az_translator.ipynb - Language Translator
* az_video_indexer_API.ipynb - using Azure AI Video Indexer API

Remark. Endpoint and access key should be stored in .env file
