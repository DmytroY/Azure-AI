# Azure  AI services

While study Azure AI I train and deploy several AI models for different use. This repo contains my examples how to connect them by API:
* az_ML_train_connect.ipynb - connecting to trained Linear Regression model.
* az_content_safety.ipynb - connecting to content safety resource.
* az_ai_search.ipynb - AI search in the indexed documents.
* az_ML_CLU.ipynb - Conversational Language Understating model for interpret voice commands.
* az_speech_recogn.ipynb - Speech to text
* az_translator.ipynb - Language Translator
Remark. Endpoint and access key should be stored in .env file
