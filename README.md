While study Azure AI I train and deploy several AI models for different use. This repo contains my examples of utilasing API for train, register and use models:
* az_ai_search.ipynb - AI search in the indexed documents.
* az_content_safety_jaibrake.ipynb - using Prompt shield of Azure content safety.
* az_content_safety_text.ipynb - using Azure content safety for categorising text in 4 categories (Hate, SelfHarm,Sexual, Violence).
* az_custom_vision.ipynb - TRAINING, REGISTERATION and PREDICTION with custom image clasification model
* az_inteligence.ipynb - Extract information from documents
* az_key_vault_usage.py - usage Azure Key Vault to access Azure Cognitive Services.
* az_ML_CLU.ipynb - Conversational Language Understating model for interpret voice commands.
* az_ML_train_connect.ipynb - connecting to trained Linear Regression model.
* az_speech_recogn.ipynb - Speech to text
* az_translator.ipynb - Language Translator

Remark. Endpoint and access key should be stored in .env file
